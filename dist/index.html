    <h1>Ably ðŸ’š Netlify</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        This application uses Netlify serverless functions to host an API, and a
        plain HTML application to render the response.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're using the Netlify serverless function to manage an Ably API Key -
        there is a tokenRequest API that serves on
        /.netlify/functions/ably-tokenRequest that provides the in-browser SDK
        with your API key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this page loads, it'll connect to an ably channel, and send a
        message - the raw messages will appear below:
      </p>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="messageInput"
        placeholder="Type a message to send to Ably"
        value="Hello from Netlify!"
      />
      <button id="sendMessage">Send Message</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
