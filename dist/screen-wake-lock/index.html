üç£ Basic Sushi Roll (Maki) Recipe

üßÇ Ingredients:
2 cups sushi rice (short-grain rice)
2 1/2 cups water (for cooking rice)
1/3 cup rice vinegar
3 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
Nori (seaweed sheets)
Fillings (choose your favorites):
Sliced raw or cooked fish (salmon, tuna, imitation crab)
Julienne cucumber
Avocado slices
Cream cheese, pickled radish, etc.
Soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger (for serving)

üçö Step 1: Prepare the Rice
Rinse sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
Cook rice with 2 1/2 cups of water (use a rice cooker or stovetop).
While rice cooks, mix vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat until dissolved. Cool it.
Once rice is done, gently fold in the vinegar mixture with a wooden spoon. Let cool to room temperature.

üçô Step 2: Roll the Sushi
Place a bamboo mat on a flat surface and cover it with plastic wrap.
Lay one sheet of nori on the mat, shiny side down.
Wet your hands and spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch strip bare at the top.
Add fillings in a line across the center.
Lift the edge of the mat and begin to roll tightly. Wet the edge of the nori to seal.
Use a sharp knife to cut into 6‚Äì8 pieces (wet the knife between cuts for clean slices).

üçΩÔ∏è Step 3: Serve
Arrange on a plate with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.
